I've redesigned the product details page using careful CSS styling, making sure features like color and size selectors are easy to use. By adding radio buttons, users can now pick their options more conveniently, making the page look better too. Plus, with JavaScript, updates like the cart message happen in real-time, giving users quick feedback. These changes aim to make shopping smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.
